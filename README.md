Name of the project:
Zamakhosi's Profile

Project Description:
So this project is more or less a mini portfolio of myself. Let's you know a bit about me and 
explains why I would like to be a developer at SovTech. Basically this is just a profile about myself,
for this project I used React and Css for styling and making it look more like me.
They most challenging part about doing this project was the styling and having to make the vision I had for it come to life and adding a few functionalities too.
