            I'm Zamakhosi Ngubane, originally from KwaZulu-Natal but currently residing
            in Kempton Park, Gauteng. I am 23 years of age and recently graduated from WeThinkCode_ .
            Prior to WeThinkCode, I attended high school at Hoerskool Birchleigh which is in Kempton park
            and thereafter I took a gap year and within that gap year I volunteerd at church
            as a videographer. I am a charasmatic person who enjoys meeting new people, in my spare time I enjoy
            reading and listening to music. If I had a compass to life honesty, hardwork, loyalty, passion and 
            determination would be my directions.

            I completed internships at QLink after both my first and final year which was in the year 2021 for my first
            internship and the year 2022 for my second internship. I learnt how to write code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
            and then also touched on Vue, Node and Laravel. At WeThinkCode I learnt Python, Java and Dart.

            I want to be  a developer at SovTech because I am a young, enthusiastic and self driven Software Engineer and
            I believe that I possess a great potential in excelling in your programme as I am eager to contribute to team success through hard work,
            attention to detail and excellent organizational skills  I have a clear understanding of implementing software solutions and considerable
            knowledge in managing and troubleshooting applications in the internal system. I am now looking for an opportunity to increase my experience
            and add value to the technology space. Given the shortage of quality skills in our country, I strongly and deeply believe that SovTech through
            its mentoring programme will give me top tier training and enable me to give my best in the software development space. Having previously worked 
            in other companies, I have come to see the value of quality leaders and trust and believe that SovTech will offer me more than that. As being with 
            SovTech will also contribute towards the sharpening of my skills and adding of more skills and will get me ready for employment. I also believe that
            values, eagerness, passion and determination make me worthy of joining the SovTech family. I am a team player, a motivator and a great communicator and 
            listener and it would be an honor and privilege to join your family.
